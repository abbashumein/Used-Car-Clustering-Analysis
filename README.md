# Used-Car-Clustering-Analysis

Used Car Clustering Analysis Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and clustering used car data using machine learning techniques. Our goal was to identify meaningful patterns in the used car market, enabling better price estimation, market segmentation, and insights for buyers and sellers.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals & Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors affecting used car prices.
Utilize unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to segment cars into meaningful groups based on attributes such as price, mileage, brand, year, and other relevant features.
Help businesses and individuals make data-driven decisions by identifying trends and pricing strategies.
ðŸ”¬ Approach & Methodology
Data Collection & Preprocessing

Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.
Standardized numerical features for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized price distribution, mileage impact, and brand-wise variations.
Checked for correlations between car features.
Clustering Models

Applied K-Means Clustering to segment the cars into groups based on similarities.
Evaluated different cluster numbers using the Elbow Method & Silhouette Score.
Used Hierarchical Clustering to validate group structures.
Results & Insights

Successfully clustered used cars into different price and condition segments.
Identified key factors influencing used car valuation.
Provided recommendations for pricing strategies based on cluster insights.
